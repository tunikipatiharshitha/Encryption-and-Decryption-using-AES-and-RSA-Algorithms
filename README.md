# Encryption-and-Decryption-using-AES-and-RSA-Algorithms
Developed a Hybrid Algorithm using two different Cryptographic Algorithm categories (AES and RSA), increasing the security in several real-time applications.

<br/>**Introduction**
<br/>The primary goal is accomplished by combining AES and RSA to create a hybrid cryptography technique that offers the benefits of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. This approach provides secure and efficient key exchange and encryption by using the benefits of each algorithm. The AES-RSA hybrid algorithm combines the best features of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption methods. This hybrid approach employs AES for symmetric key encryption, which works well for encrypting big volumes of data, and RSA for asymmetric key encryption, which is ideal for securely transferring the symmetric keys needed for AES encryption.
Here's the block diagram of the Proposed Hybrid Algorithm.

<br/>**Software used:**
<br/> Vivado and Developed using Verilog HDL.

<br/>**Methodology**
<br/>The strengths of both algorithms can be combined in a hybrid encryption method that combines AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): RSA for safe key exchange and AES for effective bulk data encryption. The process for creating such a hybrid algorithm is as follows:
